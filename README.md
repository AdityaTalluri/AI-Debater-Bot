# 🤖 Gemini Debate Simulator

This Python script hosts an **AI vs. AI debate** using Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash model. Two personas — 🧠 **Sol** and 🌙 **Luna** — go head-to-head on a chosen topic, taking turns to argue, challenge, agree, and disagree based on logic vs empathy.

> ✨ Built for experimentation, entertainment, or just watching two LLMs verbally spar like it’s an intellectual UFC.

- 🎭 Creates two AI personas:
  - **Sol** – logic-driven, fact-based, kinda blunt
  - **Luna** – empathetic, cautious, but sharp
- 🗣️ Runs a 20-turn debate with alternating replies
- 🎤 Prints live conversation output in the console
- 🏁 Ends with closing statements from both AIs
